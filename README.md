# Console-Based-Small-Online-Market-Program

This code is very primal e-shoping example

The console starts by asking predifined username and password. After creditentials are given, you will be facing with a menu that will instruct you and give you multiple choices like adding item, exiting the program or checking out. There are plenty more upgrades that can be applied on this project.



Here are some bugs within the code and feel free fix them.

1. In the first item selection part if you will write bigger than item number, its going back to asking username
2. In the update amount selecting item part if you write bigger than basket total item number, its going back to asking username
3. In the remove item part if you will write bigger than item number, its going back to asking username
